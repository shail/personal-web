Hi!

My name is Shail Patel, and I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the Maps team at Uber. I have ~9 years of experience in software, having worked at Yahoo, Brightroll, and Ooyala in the past. I've interviewed over a 1000 candidates in algorithms, system design, general problem solving, and soft skills. I provide regular interviews on interviewing.io and in my day-to-day at Uber. I've also helped candidates through offer negotiations, job selection, and overall career progression.

- 99% of interviewees would want to work with me (out of 737 interviews)
- 88% of interviewees liked the questions I asked (out of 737 interviews)
